        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chinese tea eggs, known as "cha ye dan" (茶叶蛋), are a popular street food and snack in China, celebrated for their unique flavor and visually appealing marbled appearance. These eggs are typically hard-boiled and then cracked slightly to create a network of fine cracks on the shell.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs: 6 to 8 large eggs (preferably free-range or organic)</li>
            <li>Black tea: 2 to 3 bags or 2 tablespoons of loose black tea</li>
            <li>Soy sauce: 100 to 150 milliliters (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup)</li>
            <li>Water: enough to cover the eggs in the pot (approximately 500 to 700 milliliters)</li>
            <li>Spices: star anise, cinnamon stick...</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Hard-boil the eggs and let them cool.</li>
            <li>Crack the shells gently to create a network of cracks.</li>
            <li>Simmer the eggs in a mixture of water, black tea, soy sauce, and spices for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, or longer for a stronger flavor.</li>
            <li>Let the eggs steep in the liquid for several hours or overnight for the best flavor.</li>
        </ol>
