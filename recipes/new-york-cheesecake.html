        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>New York cheesecake is a rich and creamy dessert that is renowned for its dense texture and smooth flavor. Originating from New York City, this classic cheesecake is typically made with a base of cream cheese, sugar, and eggs, which are blended together to create a velvety filling. The crust is usually made from crushed graham crackers mixed with butter and sugar, providing a sweet and slightly crunchy contrast to the creamy filling.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>For the Crust: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>200 grams graham cracker crumbs (or digestive biscuits)</li>
                    <li>100 grams unsalted butter, melted</li>
                    <li>50 grams granulated sugar</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>900 grams cream cheese, softened</li>
                    <li>200 grams granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>3 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>200 grams sour cream (optional, for added creaminess)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional, for a hint of tang)</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F).</li>
                <li>Mix Crust Ingredients: In a bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar. Mix until well combined.</li>
                <li>Form the Crust: Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 23 cm (9-inch) springform pan to create an even layer. Bake for about 10 minutes, then remove and let it cool.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Beat Cream Cheese: In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
                <li>Add Sugar: Gradually add the granulated sugar and continue to beat until well combined.</li>
                <li>Incorporate Eggs: Add the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition until just combined. Avoid overmixing.</li>
                <li>Add Flavorings: Mix in the vanilla extract, sour cream, and lemon juice (if using) until smooth.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Step 3: Bake the Cheesecake</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Pour Filling into Crust: Pour the cream cheese filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan.</li>
                <li>Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for about 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly.</li>
                <li>Cool: Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly ajar for about 1 hour to cool gradually. This helps prevent cracking.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Refrigerate: Once cooled, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
                <li>Remove from Pan: Carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan.</li>
                <li>Add Toppings: Top with fresh fruit, fruit compote, or whipped cream if desired.</li>
                <li>Slice and Enjoy: Cut into slices and serve chilled.</li>
                </ul>
